    The PARSeq is a context-aware STR(Scene Text Recognition) model. The context-aware model is proposed to recognize image
    with occluded or incomplete characters. However, in the actual license recognition process, the covered images should
    not be solved by context reasoning, and should be rejected directly, so the current practical industrial application of this model will be limited.
    Besides, since the model involves NLP-related knowledge, it will be reproduced in the future.
